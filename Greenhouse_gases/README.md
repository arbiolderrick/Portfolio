# Exploratory Report on GHG emissions from the Top 5 GDP UN countries.

  In this report, gross domestic product (GDP) is used to distinguish countries with the greatest output. Higher GDP can also be seen as a greater potential in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) as more products would have been made in a country as a result. The top five gross domestic product (GDP) countries in the UN was extracted from worldbank.org. and they are as the following: United States, Germany, United Kingdom, France, and Italy. A limitation for the data used is that it strictly looks at countries who are a part of the United Nations (UN). This report will highlight sectors where there is highest GHG emissions as well compare and contrast emissions.
